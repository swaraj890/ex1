Transforming employee data from a columnar format into a historical, row-based versioning format involves several steps to ensure accurate and efficient conversion. Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:

Reading the Input Data:
The first step is to read the input CSV file containing the employee data. Python's csv module is used for this purpose, providing functions to parse CSV files.

Data Structure Initialization:
We initialize a dictionary named employee_records to store employee records. Each record is associated with a unique employee code and contains information about compensation, reviews, and engagement.

Parsing and Organizing Data:
As we iterate through each row of the input CSV file, we organize the data into the employee_records dictionary. Each employee code serves as the key, and its corresponding value is a dictionary containing the employee's manager code, compensation history, review history, and engagement history.

Handling Missing Data:
During parsing, we convert date strings into datetime objects using the parse_date() function. If a date string is missing or invalid, it is converted to None to handle missing data gracefully.

Transformation and Historical Record Creation:
We iterate over each employee's records to create historical versions of their data. For each employee, we traverse their compensation, review, and engagement histories. We ensure that each row represents a specific period with consistent data.

Effective and End Dates Calculation:
To create historical records, we calculate effective and end dates for each period of data. The end date is set to one day before the next effective date to avoid overlap. For the latest record of an employee, we assign a far-future date (e.g., 2100-01-01) as the end date.

Writing Transformed Data to Output File:
Finally, we write the transformed data into an output CSV file formatted for historical data analysis. Each row of the output file contains fields for employee identifiers, compensation, dates, performance ratings, and engagement scores.

Handling Date Format for Output:
When writing data to the output file, we ensure that dates are formatted correctly using the strftime() function. This converts datetime objects into formatted strings suitable for CSV output.

Error Handling and Documentation:
Throughout the code, error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle potential issues gracefully. Additionally, clear documentation and comments are included to explain the logic, assumptions, and data transformations performed during the process.

Optimization and Efficiency:
The code is structured to be efficient and scalable, capable of handling large datasets while minimizing memory usage and processing time. Optimizations such as iterating efficiently through records and avoiding redundant operations are implemented to ensure optimal performance.

By following these steps, the Python script effectively transforms columnar employee data into a structured, row-based historical format suitable for database storage and analysis. The solution emphasizes accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability to meet the objectives outlined in the task requirements.
